# Assignment 1 - Shader Live Coding

- Create a one-minute or longer animation using Shawn Lawson's [The Force](https://shawnlawson.github.io/The_Force/) environment. Your animation can be through-composed (no interaction) by relying on the the `time` uniform, or performed via live-coding or other interaction techniques (mouse etc.). 

- Write two paragraphs (150–200 words) that describe your aesthetic intent and what you were interested in exploring technically. I encourage you to focus on simple ideas (dots, grids, etc.), although a crescendo that peaks with total pixel chaos is always tempting... 

- Play your animation for a classmate (this can be coordinated via Discord). Write a paragraph that describes the feedback of your classmate and whether or not it matched your expectations... and of course it's totally fine if it doesn't match them (and possibly much more interesting!). Feel free to include feedback from addition classmates / other people if you like, but only one source of feedback is required.

- Create a GLSL file that stores your code for the performance. Given that the code will probably change over the course of the performance, we leave it at your discretion whether you want to include the code from the beginning, the end, the middle... what best reveals what you did in the performance?

- Link both your video, your code, and your text on your personal website for the class (make sure the video is hosted at a permanent location such as Vimeo or Youtube). Make sure you've done the pull request in the onboarding assignment if you haven't already.

To be clear, if you're personal website is a simple github repo, after this your primary README should look something like the following:

- Assignment #1: [video](http://wpi.edu), [code](http://wpi.edu), [explanation](http://wpi.edu)

... but with correct links. 

Grading Rubric
---
- 10% Video is posted to your personal course website correctly with video in permanent hosting location
- 60% Use of a variety of different GLSL functions (at least 12, experiment!)
- 5% Development of piece throughout one minute... how does it change over time?
- 5% Visual Aesthetics. Is there a discernible theme in the work? What constraints are in place (limited color-palette, limited number of shapes etc.)? 
- 10% Two summary paragraphs. One should concisely explain what you did technically (What functions did you use? Did you combine any in interesting ways?) and the other should describe your aesthetic goals. Justify your aesthetic decisions to us!
- 10% A final paragraph describing feedback received and how it met or didn't meet your expectations

This assignment will count for 10–12.5% of your final grade, depending on whether we do four or five assignments in the course. Please take time to ensure that spelling / grammar are correct and that the assignment is linked / posted / hostted correctly so that you don't lose any easy points.

You might consider these classic abstract animations that we watched in class as sources of inspiration for doing a formal study:
